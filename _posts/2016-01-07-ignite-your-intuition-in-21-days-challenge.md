* We all have intuition and most of us have a hard time distinguishing between the (very persistent and loud) voice of our logical mind and the very sweet and soft whisper of our intuition.
* Intuition is the secret to success. Some people call it their gut feeling, some others describe it as an absolute knowing and most of us think that intuition is something for Psychics. 
* The truth is, you have amazing intuition and she's been guiding you since birth, however, nobody ever taught you who or what that whisper was.
* Intuition truly is the most beneficial and powerful guide we have been given to navigate our life with grace and ease. 
* The good news is that everyone can learn how to reconnect to our intuition and even better is that you can do it for free within 21 days. 
* 21 days of easy and fun assignments will take no more than 15 minutes per day to ignite your intuition!
